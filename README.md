- Based on 3D parts + off-the-shelf components 
- Minimum of tools required 

# Electronics 

The flowsensor and the display are connected to the ESP32 via I2C (GPIO 21/22 for SDA/SCL), wheras the Oxygen Sensor is connected to the board via an ampliefied (i.e. OPAMP) digital-analog port.

*WARNING:* The OPAMP has a high-pass filter created by a capacitor + resitor. We need to remove this to let the low-frequency signal from the Oxygen Sensor pass through.
